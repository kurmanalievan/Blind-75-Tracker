# Blind 75 Tracker

This project is designed to help solve LeetCode problems following the list of problems known as Blind 75. 

## Goals of the project

When I was preparing for the technical interviews I came across a LeetCode patterns website, which helped me a lot with preparation. I decided to try imitating the same idea and create a small platform for problems in the Blind 75 list.
I thought it was a good opportunity to learn React as well as deepen my knowledge in algorithmic problems. 

### Technologies and learnings

For creating the project I used React for building the UI and used Firestore database for backend. 
I could improve my knowledge in the resusable components of React, learned more about React Router as well Firebase and its backend services. Also, I have used json server to store the list of problems. 

### How to run
> Note: you have to have ```npm``` installed
Clone the project:
```
 git clone https://github.com/kurmanalievan/Blind-75-Tracker.git
```
Start json server:
```
 npm run server
```
From the parent directory of the project, run:
```
 npm start
```

### Futher improvements 
I will continue improving the project by adding the Authentication(Firebase) and implementing Reset functionality, which will reset the current progress of the user.
